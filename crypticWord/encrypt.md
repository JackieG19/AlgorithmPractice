## Encryption

**hello**

key = ABC

index = A = 0, B = 1, C = 2
```

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

h = move 0 over = h
e = move 1 over = f
l = move 2 over = n
l = move 0 over = l
o = move 1 over = p
```

**Modulo**
```
4 % 5 = 1 = B
4 goes into 5 - 1 remainder

5 % 3 = 2 = C
5 goes into 3 = 2 remainder

6 % 3 = 0 = A
6 goes into 3 = 3 = 0 remainder

```
