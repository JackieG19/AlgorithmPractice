var blank = "-";  pancakes faced down
var happyFace = "+" pancakes faced up :)
var count = 0; see how many moves it takes
var k = []; array of pancakes 

function flipper(){
    for(var i = 0; i < k.length; i++>){
        if you find "-"{
            flip over   
        }
        if you find "+"{
            skip over until you find "-"
        }
    }
    count++;
}

Note:
the last 2 pancakes determine if you can flip "+"
result1 all pancakes are flipped "+" = # of moves
result2 all of the pancakes are already happy side, no need to flip = 0
result3 can't flip them all = IMPOSSIBLE
